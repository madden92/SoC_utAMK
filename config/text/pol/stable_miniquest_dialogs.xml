	<string id="escape_trader_miniquest_3">
		<text>Hey, wait a second... No-no, I'm not trying to rub it from you, off course, it is totally yours present, but... I kept it safe, right? And you can get it now as simple as if the person who left it would give it to you himself. By the way, I do not know, maybe there is something harmful inside, and I'not a very healthy man now, not like in old good times... So. One hundred for keeping it for you - I think it's a fair deal. OK?</text>
