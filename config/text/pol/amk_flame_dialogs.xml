		<text>Thanks a lot, Marked One! It seems we did it... Damned crazy bastards! Though, those Monolith nutjob's aren't	the worst that could happen around here though, lately mutants have been trying to break in from the Radar area, after that it's hell here! They move pretty fast, not everyone can shoot such a quick-moving target! We had a flamethrower, a great weapon against those freaks, but it's broken now. Maybe our technician, Screw, can fix it. But how can the rest of us get out of this damned place?! With you as witness, there's not even a second for some rest! Well, it's time for a small reward for you. Is money alright?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_freedom_commander_7001">
		<text>Sure, money sounds great.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_freedom_commander_7002">
		<text>Do you have anything else?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_freedom_commander_7003">
		<text>Well, you see. We need money ourselves, listen... I'll give you 1000 and that broken flamethrower... It's useless here anyway, and as I said before, none of us are gonna fix it. I see you're a clever guy, take it to Screw, I'm sure he must have some idea for it. Believe me, it's worth much more than money when it's working!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_freedom_commander_7004">
		<text>No thanks. I don't need this piece of junk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_freedom_commander_7005">
		<text>I think that this flamethrower will be more useful.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_screw_flamethrower_1000">
		<text>Hey Screw, here you go, look at this thing. Totally busted up flamethrower. It's your friends who did it, don't look at me with such hate... I helped them a little, so they gave me this in return. They also said that only you could fix it. What do you think? Can you fix it?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_screw_flamethrower_1001">
		<text>God dammit... I spent a lot of time making this flamethrower! Imbeciles... I can't believe they broke it! The fuel hose is missing, what the hell! Did they throw into every anomaly in the Zone? Or did a God damned Chimera chewed it to hell? Well my friend... There's a lot of work to be done here. I've already worked a hell of a number of nights on it, But okay, you helped my guys, so I'll help you. Certainly, not for your charm and beauty however. I'll make a list of parts that we'll need to replace. I already got most of the parts, and some I can get off the guys around here. Think about it though, are you really gonna run all around the Zone for this thing?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_screw_flamethrower_1002">
		<text>Hell no! To Hell with this piece of shit! Will you take it off my hands for 2500?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_screw_flamethrower_1003">
		<text>Run all around the Zone? Well, what else am I here for? Tell me what you need.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_screw_flamethrower_1004">
		<text>Suit yourself, I'll take it.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_screw_flamethrower_1005">
		<text>That's good... Here's what we need:\n\n
First off, an artefact called the "Fire ball". The flamethrowers got more holes in it then Swiss cheese! I could weld most of them shut, but I wouldn't be able to do it until after Winter! But with a Fire Ball there'd be no wait, believe me, there is an unknown features in that ball, it's a useful thing indeed... \n
Secondly, we need new pipes and fuel lines (The ones I got are only good for WC, not for a flamethrower!). So get a pipe. Talk to Sidorovich... rookies often give him tons of garbage from... well... from the Garbage! And say hello to him for me.\n
Third, we need a new Manometer, or else you'll be the one getting torched. God, It looks like they opened cans with the old one. Morons, damn them... All right, find it wherever you want. I'd look for it in Agroprom area... There was an Institute there, you know, so maybe you could find something there.\n
Next, we need an ignition source, the main part. The original burner was made from titanium, I wonder... Who could've broke it, a Burer?!.. You can't get a burner from our guys... No way, no one would give it up! It is the best for a smoked sausage. Of course, you can look for it in the Barracks, without permission... But I think I know a better method, go to Barkeep, he's a packrat, so he'll probably have something like that. So buy a burner, just don't say that it's for me, if Duty know that I'm making weapons here, they will not sleep until they get me! Why the hell would I need such a problem?\n
And now, the most important part of our little repair here, Vodka... "Spiritus Vini", If you will, it has all kinds of uses... Making parts clean, and making a head clean too. Got it? Bring me some Vodka, will you? You see, I need strong motivation for a task like this... I think, five bottles would be okay... Maybe seven... Ah what the hell, bring me ten bottles. As I said, there's a lot of work to be done.\n
That's all. I think you'll make it, you are Stalker, right? Afterwards, you'll have yourself a flamethrower... I believe in you... And it would be wonderful If vodka could be the first thing that you'd look for...</text>

	<string id="mil_screw_flamethrower_1006">
		<text>Seems like I need to do some serious shopping. I hope this is worth it.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_screw_flamethrower_1007">
		<text>Trust me, it'll be worth it. By the way... It will cost you... 5000. Not too much, because I like you!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_screw_flamethrower_1008">
		<text>Wait, you said nothing about money!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_screw_flamethrower_1009">
		<text>Hey, be reasonable. I could get a million for the gun that I'm going to make for you! But I am a kind person, Marked One. Look... Who else except me will do it? So come on, man, don't be so greedy! </text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_screw_flamethrower_1010">
		<text>Damn you, Alright, I'll do it. Don't die from the Vodka before I come back.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="escape_trader_flamethrower_dialog_0">
		<text>Hey Sidorovich, I got some news from Screw. He want's to know If you remember him?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="escape_trader_flamethrower_dialog_1000">
		<text>Screw huh? Screw... My memory is not as good as it was in my youth, Marked One... But yes, I remember a Stalker named Screw. He was a real vodka-drinking devil. He could drink my stock dry, if I'd let him. I figured he'd of died from drinking. Heh... But he brought me some rare things in his younger days, and his hands are, you know, hands of a real master. He could fix everything that was broken, everything from TV's to Dosimeters... So he is still alive?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="escape_trader_flamethrower_dialog_1001">
		<text>Yes, he is. He sent me to you, he told me you have something that I need... I'm looking for an Iron pipe, not very big, Its not necessarily me who needs it, but Screw is helping me repair something... Do you have something like that?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="escape_trader_flamethrower_dialog_1002">
		<text>What? Why the hell would I need Iron pipes for? I don't keep things around that I don't need or can't sell!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="escape_trader_flamethrower_dialog_1003">
		<text>How much I need to pay you for a pipe then?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="escape_trader_flamethrower_dialog_1004">
		<text>Marked-one... Is the radiation going to your head? I'm tellin you that I dont have any Iron pipes! I can only give you a tip... You really made me glad, letting me know that Screw is still alive. So my advice to you is to meet with Alexey Tambovsky. He's always making something from all kinds of trash. He is in the Garbage now, looking for some parts for some kind of detector that picks up life-forms. I'll give you his coordinates.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="escape_trader_flamethrower_dialog_1005">
		<text>Thanks, you mean your actually going to give me advice for free? Unbelievable.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="escape_trader_flamethrower_dialog_1006">
		<text>What did you say? It seems I have problems not only with memory...</text>
	</string>

	<string id="escape_trader_flamethrower_dialog_1007">
		<text>I said, Thanks a lot! Thanks for the info. And stay well, Sidorovich.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="escape_trader_flamethrower_dialog_1008">
		<text>Yeah, my health isn't as great as it used to be.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="gar_flamethrower_0">
		<text>Hi there, what do you need?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="gar_flamethrower_1000">
		<text>Sidorovich told me you might have some sort of an Iron pipe.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="gar_flamethrower_1001">
		<text>Iron pipes eh? Hmm... I saw several on one of those radioactive hills, but I can't get them, I don't have an effective outfit. But I did write down the coordinates. If you really need them I can sell them to you almost for free. Up on the hills I decided to look for something else, but caught a wave of radiation, I just cleaned up the nosebleed. Listen to me... You get me some antirad, I'll give you the coordinates, Okay?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="gar_flamethrower_1002">
		<text>Yeah sure, but I dont have any Antirad. Your on your own. I'll look for the pipe myself.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="gar_flamethrower_1003">
		<text>Yes, you should be more careful around all this radiation. Here you go.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="gar_flamethrower_1004">
		<text>Give me your PDA. Well, look there If you wan't, I made a marking. Im sure the pipes are there, nobody could steal them. Go there.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="gar_flamethrower_1005">
		<text>Thanks a lot. Good luck with your new devices.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="barmen_flamethrower_task_0">
		<text>Hello. Listen, could you sell me a decent burner?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="barmen_flamethrower_task_1000">
		<text>A burner? Interesting question. I'm embarassed to ask, but just why would you need it?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="barmen_flamethrower_task_1001">
		<text>I'm dying to eat some smoked sausages!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="barmen_flamethrower_task_1002">
		<text>Oh really? Okay, okay, it's not my business. I have one, it seems to be working properly. Take it for 250 roubles.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="barmen_flamethrower_task_1003">
		<text>250 for this? Forget it. I'll get it myself somewhere.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="barmen_flamethrower_task_1004">
		<text>Fair price, here is your money.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_0">
		<text>You got all the parts? I hope you got the Vodka as well.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_1000">
		<text>I got everything, and your vodka too. Start working! I'm waiting for this flamethrower, and my moneys waiting on you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="parts_completed_1001">
		<text>Take it easy buddy! I said I'll make the damn thing. Just give me a day, and you get your toy.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_1002">
		<text>It's a deal. I'm waiting.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_10111">
		<text>Well, how goes the repairs? Are you almost finished?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_1003">
		<text>Whoa, M-M-Marked-one... Heh-heh, how you doin' buddy!? What you wan't from me? ...Oh right! The flamethrower... You seriously think its done already? Uhh, sorry man, I think I had a little too much to drink, and lost track of time.</text>
	</string>


	<string id="parts_completed_1004">
		<text>Are you kidding me? You said drinking helps you focus. If you'd work without drinking, your whole base could have flamethrowers, hell with you, I'll be back when your sobered up.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_1013">
		<text>Alright, you sober now? How's my flamethrower?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_1005">
		<text>Yeah Im good now, sorry... Here is your flamethrower!</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_1006">
		<text>Is that real!? I thought you'd never actually make it. Looks great, let me have it.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_1007">
		<text>Hey hold on, I'm not so drunk today. We had a deal... 10000 roubles for the repairs, remember?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_1008">
		<text>What!? Did you dissolve your brain in Vodka? It was 5000 roubles. Or would you prefer me to remind you how interested Duty would be to know what you cooked up here?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_1009">
		<text>Okay, calm down, it's 5000 roubles... Take your flamethrower. Now you can make life a little lighter. Oh yes, there is something else... That fuel ballon is enough for about a minute of torching. Then it'll be empty... Come back here and I'll refuel it for a price. It's not so simple, you must remember. I'll also need a Gasoline canister and a ballon filled with Colloid gas, which is used in the Flamethrower. Yes, I can get it all by myself, but it will cost you a lot.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_1010">
		<text>A balloon? And where could I find this?</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_1011">
		<text>Colloid gas, I'm telling you! The eggheads brought a lot with them to the Zone for their experiments. It's perfect for flame fuel. You can get it in Agroprom, and pretty much everywhere else. But better look for it now, Alright? Don't forget, a Fuel can and a Ballon of that damn Colloid.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="parts_completed_1012">
		<text>Yeah, got it. Thank you. Have fun with the rest of your vodka.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="mil_screw_flamethrower_text">
		<text>I need to find some items from the list that Screw gave me: \n\n
1. The "Fire Ball" artifact.\n
2. Pipes. Screw said Sidirivich might have some.\n
3. Pressure meter. Take a look in Agroprom Research Institute.\n
4. Burner. Ask Barkeep about it.\n
5. Ten bottles of vodka for this alcoholic.\n\n
It's going to be a long day...</text>

	<string id="trubka_descr">
		<text>Steel pipe. Bent slightly, but looks strong enough. It should be okay for the flamethrower.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="gorelka_descr">
		<text>Middle-sized burner. As stalkers say, sausage is wondeful when it's been smoked on this thing. Its used to ignite the high-temperature gel in the flamethrower.</text>

	<string id="manometr_descr">
		<text>A simple pressure meter device, from some industrial mechanism of soviet time. It's glass is dirty, but it seems to be in good condition. It should work properly on the flamethrower.</text>

		<text>Hand-made weapon, based on a army model of flamethrower, made by Screw. It's for close-combat, but its a devastating weapon. The best way for using it is to roast hordes of monsters in packs. Full charge will make it fire for about a minute.</text>

	<string id="flamethrower_basic">
		<text>Flamethrower - hand-made, but it was made with a great skill. It can be refueled in the "Freedom" base by Screw. It's not a wide-spread technology, so fuel is rare too. It consists of standard gasoline (Stored in simple canisters) and special Colloid gas (Stored in red marked ballons). Screw said that there are a lot in the Agroprom area, but they can be found anywhere. Of course, Screw can find it himself, but it will cost a lot. And as always, he will need a bottle of vodka for himself.</text>
